<p>Founders will come to Silicon Valley for the two weeks, where they will have the opportunity to live and collaborate with like-minded entrepreneurs from all around the world and take part in an intense agenda of meetings and workshops with <em>entrepreneurs, investors, experts and executives</em>.  Accepted startups must have launched a technology based MVP and gathered feedback from early adopter/customers. Ideally - but not required - a startup should have raised some investment capital, have a team between 3 to 20 people and have a product or service that can be launched globally.</p>

                    <p>Blackbox Connect is an amazing opportunity to plant a foothold in Silicon Valley, for world-class startups born outside of the US. Join a selection of some of the best teams from around the world, as you learn together about the special culture of the Valley, and how things are different here.  Opportunities to meet with (and pitch to), truly amazing people, combine with practical assistance on visas, opening bank accounts and establishing a US entity. In essence Blackbox Connect is the gateway to Silicon Valley.</p>

                    <p>Blackbox Connect has changed the scope of my ambition and the speed of our development as a company, and of myself as founder. We've since expanded into Germany and Russia after our first steps into the UK and Belgium. The Russian site is being locally run by a business partner who I met because we were both participating in the first BC, so that's a very concrete example of growth coming out of Blackbox!</p>
                    <p>So what started as a local training course comparison site in The Netherlands, is now actually becoming the "Amazon of Learning".</p>

                    <p>These two weeks at the Blackbox Mansion was a unique and exceptional experience. It's really changed my mindset. I arrived with a French company and I left with a company that has the ability to become a world leader. The advice and feedback from great mentors, the discussion with all the 12 international founders, practical workshops on our product and positioning and the Silicon Valley spirit, all these things really show you that there is a formula you can follow to build a successful global company.</p>

                    <p>In the past two weeks the picture of how to build a business got much clearer than during my last two years. There are many talented people gathered from all over the world in Silicon Valley, and you get to meet with them, listen to what they say and apply to your own business. People in the Valley gather experience which sums up in thousands of years of entrepreneurship and they are open to sharing it.</p>
