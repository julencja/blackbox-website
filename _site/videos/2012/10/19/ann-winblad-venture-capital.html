        <h1>Venture Capital in Silicon Valley</h1>

		<section class="videoDescription">   		
		<p>Ann Winblad from Hummer Winblad Venture Partners talks at Blackbox Connect Summer 2012.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that simple to get funded in Silicon Valley even though it feels like that it doesn&#8217;t take that much. Venture capitalists have a higher bar than Business Angles because they are taking care of other peoples money too. Do you know how to land a customer? Can you build a pull model and a push model? Don&#8217;t make it too hard &#8212; go for the easiest point of entry. Go find a big company and hold on to it. Build a relationship. VC&#8217;s have to know that you are a businessperson that can run a company.</p>
