            We work only with people who care about the problems they solve. 
            We don't get too attached to your product idea, nor we expect you to do so.</p>
            <p>Instead, we want you to show us what it is <em>you want to cure</em> that pains you, 
            and why you are the best person to implement the cure.
            </p>
            <p>Like these guys:</p>

                    <p>I came to Silicon Valley 20 years ago, and I've been working with startups here since 1996. Having been closely involved with over 100 early stage companies, most of which exited or are still growing, I discovered that entrepreneurship is all about self-leadership. Success of a founder is not a matter of funding, or skills, or diplomas &mdash; it's all about how well he knows himself and expresses himself to the world in a way that creates value.</p>

                    <p>I started Blackbox in 2010 with a vision to build a global ecosystem to nurture ambitious change makers and innovators no matter where they live or work. We're building the global fabric of entrepreneurial community around the world.</p>
                    <p>If you're a purposeful driven individual who wants to use or invest in technology to improve lives, I want to hear from you.</p>
