                    <p>Blackbox Connect has changed the scope of my ambition and the speed of our development as a company, and of myself as founder. We've since expanded into Germany and Russia after our first steps into the UK and Belgium. The Russian site is being locally run by a business partner who I met because we were both participating in the first BC, so that's a very concrete example of growth coming out of Blackbox!</p>
                    <p>So what started as a local training course comparison site in The Netherlands, is now actually becoming the "Amazon of Learning".</p>

                    <p>These two weeks at the Blackbox Mansion was a unique and exceptional experience. It's really changed my mindset. I arrived with a French company and I left with a company that has the ability to become a world leader. The advice and feedback from great mentors, the discussion with all the 12 international founders, practical workshops on our product and positioning and the Silicon Valley spirit, all these things really show you that there is a formula you can follow to build a successful global company.</p>

                    <p>In the past two weeks the picture of how to build a business got much clearer than during my last two years. There are many talented people gathered from all over the world in Silicon Valley, and you get to meet with them, listen to what they say and apply to your own business. People in the Valley gather experience which sums up in thousands of years of entrepreneurship and they are open to sharing it.</p>

                    <p>Blackbox is a great experience! For two weeks I've been in the heart of Silicon Valley's ecosystem, meeting and learning from lots of entrepreneurs and investors. It blew my mind and helped me think really big. Don't miss it if you're an entrepreneur who wants to change the world.</p>
