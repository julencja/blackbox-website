Ann Winblad from Hummer Winblad Venture Partners talks at Blackbox Connect Summer 2012.

It's not that simple to get funded in Silicon Valley even though it feels like that it doesn't take that much. Venture capitalists have a higher bar than Business Angels because they are taking care of other peoples money too. Do you know how to land a customer? Can you build a pull model and a push model? Don't make it too hard -- go for the easiest point of entry. Go find a big company and hold on to it. Build a relationship. VC's have to know that you are a businessperson that can run a company.
